My project that I have been working on is a discord bot written in Python.

To contenerize it I:
1. prepared Dockerfile that install Python and all required dependencies of the project
2. built and published the image to DockerHub
3. prepared docker-compose.yml file that runs the app as well as defines voluems and env-file name
